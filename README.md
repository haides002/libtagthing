# Libtagthing

A collection of functions to share code between tagthing frontends.

## Principles

- Statelessness
- Keeping it simple

### Statelessness
Meaning no database so you can move your files however you want because tagthing won't keep track of where they are to associate data with the files.

And because sidecar files are a hassle for now we won't do any of those either (also a lot of formats support XMP or other metadata formats which we'll use)
